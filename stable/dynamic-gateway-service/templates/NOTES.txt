NOTE: High-performance peering is enabled.
      If upgrading an existing deployment which did not previously have high-performance peering enabled, this may
      cause problems with rate-limits and subscriptions which may persist after the changes have been rolled-out.
      Please see the IBM Knowledge Center for more details.
